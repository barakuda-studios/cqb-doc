# CQB Documentation

This is the documentation concerning the Barakuda Studios game, [Close Quarter Battle](http://www.indiedb.com/games/close-quarter-battle)

In this doc you'll find infos about pretty much every script running the game

The game isn't open sourced yet because we have no idea how to open source only the code without the asset, and if it would be worth it, so this document will be mainly used so we don't forget how the script work

## How to read it

The file `structure.md` will detail the global structure of the program, explaining the role of each script

Then each script will have its doc ( x.cs will have its doc x.md explaining the role of the script and of every variable and function )
